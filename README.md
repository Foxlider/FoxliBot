# FoxliBot
New Discord bot made to replace DLBot

# Installation : 
  - Just get the token from Discord
  - Put the token in a file called 'keyfile.key' in JSON ('key':'aRandomToken')
  - Launch the BOT
  - TADAAAAA !

But honestly, why would you run this bot if mine is already running ?

# Use : 
Click on the link below to make the bot join a server :
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=324471059816382464&scope=bot


# Commands
  - shutdown             : To shutdown the BOT (quite obvious)
  - addaudio [file]      : Add a file to be played with audioplay
  - audioplay [filename] : play an audio file
  - ytsearch [query]     : Search for a youtube link
  - ytsearchplay [query] : ytsearch but play the video instead of displaying it
  - ytplay [link]        : Play a youtube video from its link
  - quote [id]           : To quote a specific tweet by sending its ID

THE END
